# Section 4 — Tasks and Channels

**This section is normative.**

This section specifies Safe's concurrency model. Safe provides concurrency through static tasks and typed channels as first-class language constructs. Tasks are declared at package level and create exactly one task each. Channels are typed, bounded-capacity, blocking FIFO queues. Tasks communicate exclusively through channels — no shared mutable state between tasks.

---

## 4.1 Task Declarations

### Syntax

1. A task is declared at the top level of a package:

```
task_declaration ::=
    'task' defining_identifier
        [ 'with' 'Priority' '=>' static_expression ] 'is'
    [ declarative_part ]
    'begin'
        handled_sequence_of_statements
    'end' defining_identifier ';'
```

### Legality Rules

2. A task declaration shall appear only at the top level of a package (as a `package_item`). A conforming implementation shall reject any task declaration appearing within a subprogram body, block statement, or nested scope.

3. Each task declaration creates exactly one task. There are no task types, no dynamic task creation, no task arrays.

4. The `defining_identifier` after `end` shall match the `defining_identifier` after `task`. A conforming implementation shall reject any task where the end identifier does not match.

5. If a `Priority` aspect is specified, the static expression shall evaluate to a value in the range `System.Any_Priority`. A conforming implementation shall reject a priority value outside this range.

6. A task declaration shall not bear the `public` keyword. Tasks are execution entities internal to the package.

7. Task declarations shall not be nested. A task body shall not contain another task declaration. A conforming implementation shall reject any task declaration appearing within a task body.

### Static Semantics

8. The `defining_identifier` of a task declaration introduces a name in the enclosing package's declarative region. This name is not a type name and cannot be used as a type mark.

9. If no `Priority` is specified, the task has the default priority defined by the implementation. The default priority shall be documented by the implementation.

### Dynamic Semantics

10. Each task declaration creates a single task that begins execution after all package-level initialisation completes (see §4.7).

11. The task executes its `handled_sequence_of_statements` as an independent thread of control. Scheduling among tasks is preemptive priority-based. Tasks of equal priority are scheduled in implementation-defined order.

---

## 4.2 Channel Declarations

### Syntax

12. A channel is a typed, bounded FIFO queue declared at the top level of a package:

```
channel_declaration ::=
    [ 'public' ] 'channel' defining_identifier ':' subtype_mark
        'capacity' static_expression ';'
```

### Legality Rules

13. A channel declaration shall appear only at the top level of a package. A conforming implementation shall reject any channel declaration appearing within a subprogram body, task body, or nested scope.

14. The element type (`subtype_mark`) shall be a definite type (not an unconstrained array or unconstrained discriminated type). A conforming implementation shall reject a channel whose element type is indefinite.

15. The capacity (`static_expression`) shall evaluate to a positive integer. A conforming implementation shall reject a channel with a capacity less than 1.

16. A channel may bear the `public` keyword to make it visible to client packages for cross-package communication.

### Static Semantics

17. A channel declaration introduces a name in the enclosing package's declarative region. This name denotes a channel object, not a type.

18. The storage required for a channel is bounded: element size multiplied by capacity, plus implementation-defined overhead for the queue structure. The allocation strategy (static, pre-allocated, or other) is implementation-defined.

### Dynamic Semantics

19. A channel is initially empty. Its lifetime is the lifetime of the enclosing package (i.e., the lifetime of the program, since packages are not deallocated).

20. A channel is a FIFO queue: elements are dequeued in the order they were enqueued.

21. **Ceiling priority.** When the implementation maps channels to underlying synchronisation mechanisms, it shall assign a ceiling priority to each channel. The ceiling priority of a channel shall be at least the maximum of the priorities of all tasks that access that channel (directly or transitively through subprogram calls). This is required to prevent priority inversion.

---

## 4.3 Channel Operations

### Syntax

22.

```
send_statement ::=
    'send' channel_name ',' expression ';'

receive_statement ::=
    'receive' channel_name ',' name ';'

try_send_statement ::=
    'try_send' channel_name ',' expression ',' name ';'

try_receive_statement ::=
    'try_receive' channel_name ',' name ',' name ';'
```

### Legality Rules

23. The expression in a `send` or `try_send` shall be of the channel's element type or a subtype thereof.

24. The `name` in a `receive` or `try_receive` shall denote a variable of the channel's element type or a subtype thereof.

25. The final `name` in `try_send` and `try_receive` shall denote a variable of type `Boolean`.

26. Channel operations may appear in subprogram bodies, task bodies, and other statement contexts. They shall not appear at the package level (no package-level statements, §3.2.4).

### Dynamic Semantics

27. **`send Ch, Value;`** — Enqueue `Value` into channel `Ch`. If `Ch` is full (number of elements equals capacity), the current task blocks until space becomes available. The blocking is on the current task only, not the entire program.

28. **`receive Ch, Variable;`** — Dequeue the front element of channel `Ch` into `Variable`. If `Ch` is empty, the current task blocks until an element becomes available.

29. **`try_send Ch, Value, Success;`** — Attempt to enqueue `Value` into channel `Ch` without blocking. If `Ch` is not full, the element is enqueued and `Success` is set to `True`. If `Ch` is full, no element is enqueued and `Success` is set to `False`.

30. **`try_receive Ch, Variable, Success;`** — Attempt to dequeue the front element of channel `Ch` without blocking. If `Ch` is not empty, the element is dequeued into `Variable` and `Success` is set to `True`. If `Ch` is empty, `Variable` is unchanged and `Success` is set to `False`.

31. Channel operations are atomic with respect to other channel operations on the same channel. The implementation shall ensure that concurrent `send` and `receive` operations on the same channel do not corrupt the channel state.

---

## 4.4 Select Statement

### Syntax

32.

```
select_statement ::=
    'select'
        select_arm
    { 'or' select_arm }
    'end' 'select' ';'

select_arm ::=
    channel_arm | delay_arm

channel_arm ::=
    'when' defining_identifier ':' subtype_mark 'from' channel_name '=>'
        sequence_of_statements

delay_arm ::=
    'delay' expression '=>'
        sequence_of_statements
```

### Legality Rules

33. A `select` statement shall contain at least one `channel_arm`.

34. At most one `delay_arm` may appear in a `select` statement. A conforming implementation shall reject a `select` with more than one `delay_arm`.

35. Only receive operations appear in `select` arms, not send. A conforming implementation shall reject any `select` arm that attempts a send operation.

36. The `subtype_mark` in a `channel_arm` shall match the element type of the named channel.

37. The `defining_identifier` in a `channel_arm` introduces a new variable, scoped to the statements of that arm.

38. The `expression` in a `delay_arm` shall be of type `Duration` or a type convertible to `Duration`.

### Dynamic Semantics

39. **Arm selection semantics.** When the `select` statement is evaluated, the implementation tests each arm in declaration order (top to bottom). The first arm whose channel has data available is selected. If no channel arm is ready and a delay arm is present, the implementation waits until either a channel arm becomes ready or the delay expires, whichever occurs first.

40. If the delay expires before any channel arm becomes ready, the delay arm is selected.

41. If multiple channels become ready simultaneously (e.g., data arrives on two channels between scheduling quanta), the first listed channel arm is selected. This is deterministic — arm ordering in source code determines priority. There is no random selection.

42. If no channel arm is ready and no delay arm is present, the `select` blocks until one channel arm becomes ready.

43. Once an arm is selected, its `sequence_of_statements` is executed. For a channel arm, the received value is bound to the `defining_identifier` before the statements execute.

44. **Starvation.** A channel whose arm is listed later in a `select` may be starved if earlier arms are always ready. This is by design — it gives the programmer explicit priority control via declaration order.

---

## 4.5 Task-Variable Ownership

### Legality Rules

45. **No shared mutable state between tasks.** Each package-level variable shall be accessed by at most one task. The implementation shall verify this at compile time. A conforming implementation shall reject any program where a package-level variable is accessed by more than one task.

46. **Access determination.** A task accesses a package-level variable if:

   (a) The variable appears directly in the task body.

   (b) The variable appears in a subprogram called (directly or transitively) from the task body.

47. **Cross-package transitivity.** For subprograms in `with`'d packages, the implementation shall use the effect summaries from dependency interface information (Section 3, §3.3.1(d)) to determine which package-level variables are accessed. The ownership check shall be completable from the compilation unit's source plus its direct and transitive dependency interface information, without access to dependency source code.

48. **Variables not accessed by any task** remain accessible to non-task subprograms (package-level initialisation expressions and subprograms not called from any task body).

49. **Subprograms callable from multiple tasks.** A subprogram shall not access any package-level variable if it is callable from more than one task. A conforming implementation shall reject any subprogram that accesses a package-level variable and is callable from multiple task bodies.

50. **Channels are not variables.** Channel operations do not constitute "access to a package-level variable" for the purposes of this ownership rule. Channels are the designated mechanism for inter-task communication.

### Static Semantics

51. The task-variable ownership analysis produces a mapping from each package-level variable to at most one task. This mapping is a static property of the program.

52. For mutually recursive subprograms, the implementation may use a fixed-point computation to determine the complete set of variables accessed.

---

## 4.6 Non-Termination Legality Rule

### Legality Rules

53. Tasks shall not terminate. A conforming implementation shall enforce the following constraints on every task body:

   (a) The outermost statement of the task body's `handled_sequence_of_statements` shall be an unconditional `loop` statement (`loop ... end loop;`). Declarations may precede the loop.

   (b) A `return` statement shall not appear anywhere within a task body. A conforming implementation shall reject any `return` statement within a task body.

   (c) No `exit` statement within the task body shall name or otherwise target the outermost loop. `exit` statements targeting inner loops within the task body are permitted.

54. These constraints are syntactic restrictions checkable without control-flow analysis or whole-program analysis.

55. Some theoretically non-terminating forms (e.g., `while True loop ... end loop;`) are not accepted. The unconditional `loop` form is trivially verifiable by any implementation.

---

## 4.7 Task Startup

### Dynamic Semantics

56. All package-level declarations and initialisations across all compilation units complete before any task begins executing. This is a language-level sequencing guarantee.

57. The order of package initialisation across compilation units is a topological sort of the `with` dependency graph (Section 3, §3.4.2).

58. Once all initialisation is complete, all tasks begin execution. The order in which tasks are activated relative to each other is implementation-defined.

59. **Informative note.** When targeting Ada/SPARK tasking under Ravenscar or Jorvik profile restrictions, `pragma Partition_Elaboration_Policy(Sequential)` is the standard mechanism for ensuring library-level task activation is deferred until all library units are elaborated. The normative requirement is the language-level guarantee stated in paragraph 56; the mechanism for achieving it is implementation-defined.
